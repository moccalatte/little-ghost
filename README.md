# Little Ghost — Telegram Userbot

Little Ghost is a powerful and modular Telegram userbot system built with Python, featuring Telethon and `python-telegram-bot`. This project allows you to automate actions on your Telegram account through a secure and easy-to-use bot interface.

The system consists of two main components:
1.  **Wizard Bot**: A Telegram bot (`python-telegram-bot`) that serves as a secure interface to manage your userbots. Only the admin can access it.
2.  **Userbot Service**: A background service (`Telethon`) that executes automated tasks such as data scraping, message replies, or broadcasting.

## Key Features
- **Wizard-Based Management**: Control all your userbots from a single, secure wizard bot.
- **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple userbot accounts simultaneously.
- **Task-Based Architecture**: The wizard delegates tasks to the userbot service, which runs them asynchronously.
- **Session String Generator**: Create Telethon session strings directly from the wizard via OTP/QR code without leaving the app.
- **Group & Channel Scraping**: Get a complete list of all groups and channels your userbot has joined.
- **Local Storage**: All data (sessions, tasks, configurations) is stored locally in an SQLite database.
- **Detailed Logging**: Activities are logged to files for easy debugging.
- **Per-Admin Conversation Logs**: Every wizard interaction is saved in `logs/wizard/users/{telegram_id}.log` for easy review.
- **Automated QA**: The Admin menu provides sequential automated testing to ensure all userbot commands remain functional after changes.
- **Keyword Rules 🎯**: Auto Reply & Watcher now support word-specific matches, AND/OR combinations, and a kid-friendly wizard flow to configure them safely.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A Telegram account with API access.

### 2. Obtain Required Credentials

You will need four main credentials to put into your `.env` file:

- `WIZARD_BOT_TOKEN`: The token for your Wizard Bot. Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
- `ADMIN_CHAT_ID`: Your Telegram chat ID. Get it by sending a message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
- `API_ID` and `API_HASH`: Your Telegram API credentials. Get them from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) under "API development tools."

### 3. Project Configuration

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd little-ghost
   ```

2. **Create the `.env` file:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Grant execution permissions to the script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/dev.sh
   ```

## How to Run

This project is designed to be run with a script that handles dependency installation, service execution (Wizard and Userbot), and logging.

### Run Wizard and Userbot Concurrently

**Run the development environment:**
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

The script performs the following actions:
1. Creates a `.venv` if it doesn't exist and ensures `pip` is available.
2. Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` into the `.venv`.
3. Checks for existing running instances using PID files.
4. Runs the **Wizard Bot** and **Userbot Service** in parallel with different PIDs.
5. Displays combined logs (`logs/wizard.log`, `logs/userbot.log`).

Need longer log tails? Use `./scripts/dev.sh --follow-logs` or switch to `./scripts/dev_dre.sh` for an interactive run that stays attached until you press `Ctrl+C`.

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Start the Wizard Bot
- Open a chat with your Wizard Bot on Telegram.
- Send the `/start` or `/menu` command at any time to bring up the main keyboard.

### Step 2: Create or Add a Userbot
- **🧙‍♂️ Create Userbot**: Follow the OTP/QR flow directly from the wizard. You can enter your phone number manually or use the "📱 Share Phone Number" button.
- **🪄 Token Login**: Send an existing Telethon Session String. The wizard saves it to SQLite, and the userbot is ready to go.

### Step 3: Manage the Userbot
1. Select **"🛠️ Manage Userbot"** and choose the userbot you want to manage.
2. The reply keyboard shows command buttons such as `🤖 Auto Reply`, `👀 Watcher`, `📢 Broadcast`, `📊 Job Status`, `⛔ Stop Jobs`, and navigation options.
3. Each flow guides you step by step—Auto Reply and Watcher now ask whether keywords should match whole words or substrings and whether you require ALL or ANY matches before executing.
4. The wizard saves instructions to the `tasks` table, and the Userbot Service executes them asynchronously. Use `📜 Watcher Logs` for quick summaries of recent watcher runs.

### Admin Extras
- `🧪 Automated Testing` lets you dry-run the core commands. Pick `Test all groups & channels` or enter specific IDs, and the system will validate both relaxed and strict keyword rules.
- `👷 Manage Userbot (WIP)` currently ships with `📂 Sync Users Groups` to refresh the cached chat list and append results to `logs/admin/sync_<telegram_id>.log`.

## Troubleshooting

- Check the service logs in `logs/wizard.log` and `logs/userbot.log` for error messages.
- User activity logs are stored in `logs/wizard/users/{telegram_userid}.log`.
- If the virtual environment causes issues, delete the `.venv` folder and run `./scripts/dev.sh` again to recreate it.
- If services stop unexpectedly, check the PID files in `pids/` and ensure no zombie processes are left.
  ```bash
  # Check for running processes
  ps aux | grep "services.wizard.main"
  ps aux | grep "services.userbot.main"

  # Terminate if necessary
  pkill -f services.wizard.main
  pkill -f services.userbot.main
  ```
